 * │ GBFS is an open standard that exists so trip planners can read a bike    │
 * │ system's live state; cities frequently require operators to publish it   │
 * │ as a permit condition. There is no key, no contract and no access        │

 * │                                                                          │
 * │ Unlike a rate card, this changes minute to minute: the feeds declare a   │
 * │ 60-second TTL and station counts move constantly. A quote here names a   │
 * │ specific station with a specific number of bikes in it right now.        │
 * │                                                                          │

 * │ • No quote unless a real station has a bike AND another has a free dock  │
 * │   within a short walk. "This city has bikes" is not a price.             │
 * │ • The fare band comes from ride duration, which genuinely varies. The    │
 * │   unlock fee and per-minute rate are published figures.                  │
 * │ • Category is BIKE, never a vehicle class. It is a different mode and is │
 * │   kept out of the car comparison.                                        │
