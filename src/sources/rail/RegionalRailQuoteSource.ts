 * │ A regulated taxi fare follows the city the trip *starts* in. That rule   │
 * │ is right — a New York medallion cab may not pick up in Westchester — and │
 * │ it meant a suburban pickup produced an entirely empty comparison, on a   │
 * │ screen that had already drawn the route and named the distance.          │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ The commuter railroad has no such gap. Its fare is published, fixed by   │
 * │ the authority, identical for every rider, and for a trip into town it is │
 * │ usually both the cheapest option and one of the fastest.                 │
 * │                                                                          │

 * │ • This prices the rail leg, and says so. The distance from each endpoint │
 * │   to its station rides along with the quote and is shown on the card.    │
 * │ • The fare is exact, so it is an UPFRONT_QUOTE — unless the rider's      │
 * │   boarding window straddles a peak boundary, when it becomes the band    │
 * │   between the two published fares and nothing in between.                │
 * │ • Category is TRANSIT. It is not a car and never competes as one.        │
 * │ • Party size multiplies: every rider buys a ticket.                      │
